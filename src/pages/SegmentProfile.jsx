They see regulation, bureaucracy, and global treaties as obstacles designed to slow America down while rivals like China race ahead.

They want America to win the innovation race against China and globalists, even if that means breaking old rules.",

    persona:{quote:"Digital tools, AI, and start-ups can universalize care faster than big bureaucracies—let's remove red tape.",
      believe:"They see America’s health crisis as a supply-and-access problem that demands more of everything that works—more clinicians, more primary care, more mental-health capacity, more affordable coverage, and faster pathways from lab to patient. Government is a partner, not a savior: regulate where it matters, fund discovery, require employer responsibility, and give consumers real power over data and choice. They are pro-science with guardrails—comfortable with early access and post-market evidence, but insistent that AI diagnostics be regulated like medical devices and that clinical research be transparent. Culturally they are center-left populists: proud of the country, more traditional on family questions than other Democrats, skeptical of corporate “woke” branding, and keen on protecting American workers in trade and immigration policy. They distrust corporate power in health care—especially pharma’s profits and patent games—yet they’re not anti-business; they want markets that serve patients.",
      want:"They want capacity and affordability built at once: protect Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, require large employers to offer coverage, and add a public option to discipline prices. Let Medicare negotiate drug prices, curb patent abuse, and give patients data portability and data ownership rights. Fund NIH/CDC while accelerating access—early/compassionate use after Phase I, with real-world evidence to confirm benefit. Put real money into community mental-health and addiction care, allow mandated treatment for the severely ill unhoused when necessary and humane, and keep rural hospitals open with targeted subsidies. Label GMOs, regulate AI in medicine strictly, and offer wellness discounts in insurance. On hot-button issues they split the difference: cover gender-affirming care for adults, but restrict irreversible procedures for minors; respect patient autonomy and clinician conscience while avoiding blanket “natural-immunity-only” rules in future pandemics.",
      doWhat:"Day to day they practice mainstream wellness without the fads. Majorities take supplements and read labels; many use fitness trackers and go to the gym; a smaller share tries complementary therapies. They’re not heavy influencers online, but they do share health tips occasionally. At work they navigate employer benefits, price-shop for care, and expect seamless digital access to their records. Politically they show up for practical fixes—bond issues for hospital expansions, school-based counseling, workforce initiatives that train nurses and community health workers.",
      whoAre:"Female-leaning (≈64%), median age mid-50s, highly college-educated (≈64% BA+), and suburban-urban (≈57% suburban, ≈30% urban). Racially they are mostly White (~78%) with meaningful Asian (~6%) and Hispanic (~8%) presence. Insurance skews employer coverage (~54%) with additional Medicaid (~11%), Medicare Advantage (~9%), and individual-market (~12%) enrollment. A quarter report union ties (~26%). Religiously they are the least churched of the Democratic clusters (large atheist/agnostic/“nothing in particular” share), yet they score proud to be American and lean worker-protection on trade and immigration. Nearly half think the U.S. is less healthy than peer nations, which fuels their urgency for capacity-building and reform."}},

The system does not need to be torn down — it needs to work consistently for people who have planned, paid in, and now depend on it. They believe experts matter, institutions matter, and evidence matters — but only insofar as those institutions deliver predictability and protection. They are deeply skeptical of sweeping reforms that put coverage, benefits, or access at risk, especially for older Americans who cannot “wait it out” if something goes wrong. Their defining belief is not ideology, but risk intolerance: healthcare policy should never gamble with people’s security.",
      want:"They want to protect and improve what people already rely on — Medicare, Medicare Advantage, prescription drug coverage, and ACA protections for older and near-retirement Americans. They support closing gaps, lowering out-of-pocket costs, and negotiating drug prices, but strongly oppose reforms that threaten continuity of care or destabilize coverage. They favor incremental expansion, careful pilots, and reforms that can be reversed if they fail. They want technology used to simplify care and reduce cost, but only when privacy, fairness, and oversight are guaranteed. Their instinct is always: prove it works before you scale it.",
      doWhat:"They vote at extremely high rates, contact lawmakers, respond to policy alerts, and engage through trusted membership organizations rather than protests. They follow healthcare debates closely, read explainers, and ask pointed questions about implementation, transition risk, and unintended consequences.",
      whoAre:"Median age late 60s, but spanning late-50s pre-retirees through older seniors. Predominantly suburban, mixed income but risk-averse, with fixed or semi-fixed incomes.

      believe:"They believe climate change is the single most important health challenge of the 21st century — the force multiplier that worsens nearly every other health risk. Because climate-driven health threats do not respect borders, they believe modern health challenges are fundamentally global and institutional. Pandemics, supply-chain disruptions, antimicrobial resistance, and emerging technologies cannot be managed by markets or nations acting alone. Only coordinated expert institutions — domestic and international — have the scale, continuity, and authority required to respond effectively.",
      want:"They want the United States to support a robust global health system. That means sustained funding for NIH, CDC, FDA, and strong engagement with international bodies like the WHO and global research consortia. They support drug-price oversight and guardrails, but oppose blunt policies that would undermine biomedical innovation or private-sector participation. They want expert-driven regulation, predictable rules for industry, global standards for safety and data, and coordinated pandemic preparedness. They favor expanding access and affordability through institutional reform — not through dismantling private insurance or replacing the system wholesale.",
      doWhat:"They vaccinate, follow public-health guidance, and rely on mainstream medical care. They defend expert agencies during crises, push back on populist attacks against science, and advocate for policy solutions that preserve institutional continuity. They participate in policy debates through professional networks, advisory roles, NGOs, and industry-government partnerships rather than street-level activism. They are more likely to argue for “fixing governance” than for moral confrontation, and more likely to warn about unintended consequences than to celebrate disruption.",
      whoAre:"Slightly younger and highly educated, urban or close-in suburban. Many work in policy, academia, or international development. Politically center-left, institutionally loyal, and culturally liberal on issues like reproductive freedom and climate change, but cautious about sweeping structural overhauls. They are comfortable with complexity and allergic to ideological absolutism."}},
